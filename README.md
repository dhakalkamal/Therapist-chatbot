# The-therapist-bot
A bot with the ability to share happiness and sorrow and make the user feel better.

## UPDATE
This chatbot was made for the AALTO UNIVERSITY SNLP course together with a colleague. The main repo can be seen in my profile as Therapist-bot.
The chatbot was built with RASA framework. The dataset was collected by both of us and we trained the dataset with BERT, GPT-2 and other pretrained models with
several hyperparameters. NOw I got access to GPT-3 licence, I just wanted to play with it and see how it behaves.
I am not sure how far this will go, so a seperate repo :D
